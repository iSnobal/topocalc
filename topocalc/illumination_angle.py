def illumination_angle(slope, aspect, azimuth, cos_z=None, zenith=None):
    """
    Calculate the cosine of the local illumination angle over a DEM.
    Solves the following equation

    cos(ts) = cos(t0) * cos(S) + sin(t0) * sin(S) * cos(phi0 - A)

    where
        t0 is the illumination angle on a horizontal surface
        phi0 is the azimuth of illumination
        S is slope in radians
        A is aspect in radians

    Slope and aspect are expected to come from the IPW gradient command:
        * Slope is stored as sin(S) with range from 0 to 1
        * Aspect is stored as radians from south (aspect 0 is toward the south)
          with range from -pi to pi, with negative values to the west and positive
          values to the east.

    Args:
        slope: numpy array of sine of slope angles sin(S)
        aspect: numpy array of aspect in radians from south
        azimuth: azimuth in degrees to the sun -180..180 (comes from sunang)
        cos_z: cosine of the zenith angle 0..1 (comes from sunang)
        zenith: the solar zenith angle 0..90 degrees

    At least one of the cosz or zenith must be specified.  If both are
    specified the zenith is ignored

    Returns:
        mu: numpy matrix of the cosine of the local illumination angle cos(ts)

    This python function is an interpretation of the IPW shade() function and follows
    as close as possible. All equations are based on Dozier & Frew, 1990.
